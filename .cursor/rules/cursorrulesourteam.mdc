# Network Marketing CRM - Project Specific Rules

This is a Network Marketing CRM with a simple UI for non-technical users.
Backend handles complex multi-company hierarchies, but frontend must be radically simple.

## Project Context
- Target Users: Non-technical network marketers
- Key Features: Contact management, email templates, training videos, landing pages
- Design Philosophy: Celebration-focused, friendly, never overwhelming

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- State: Zustand (global), React Query (server state)
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime)
- Email: Resend
- Deployment: Vercel

## Project Structure
- /app - Next.js app router pages
- /components - Shared components
- /actions - Server actions
- /lib - Utilities
- /types - TypeScript types

## UI/UX Requirements
- Large touch targets (minimum 44px)
- Celebration animations for user actions (confetti, etc.)
- Friendly empty states with illustrations
- One-click actions wherever possible
- Pre-filled forms with smart defaults
- Success feedback for every action

## Component Patterns
- Dashboard shows: greeting, quick actions, progress metrics
- Forms: minimal fields, smart defaults
- Lists: search, filter, infinite scroll
- Always show loading skeletons, never spinners

## Database Conventions

- member_id references the current user
- Include created_at, updated_at timestamps
- Soft delete with deleted_at when applicable
