# Realtime Connection Issues - Troubleshooting Guide

## Issues Identified

Your application is experiencing several realtime connection problems:

1. **Multiple subscription error**: "tried to subscribe multiple times"
2. **WebSocket connection failures**: Connection closing before establishment
3. **Duplicate channel subscriptions**: Same channels being subscribed to multiple times

## Root Causes

### 1. Multiple Subscriptions to Same Channels
- `useDashboardRealtime()` and `useContactsRealtime()` were both subscribing to the `contacts` table
- This created conflicting subscriptions with identical channel names
- Supabase doesn't allow multiple subscriptions to the same channel

### 2. Callback Dependency Issues
- React hooks were including callback functions in dependency arrays
- Callbacks were recreated on every render, causing re-subscriptions
- This created a cycle of subscribe/unsubscribe events

### 3. Insufficient Channel Cleanup
- Previous channels weren't properly cleaned up before creating new ones
- Memory leaks from unclosed channels
- Stale connections persisting

## Fixes Implemented

### ‚úÖ 1. Fixed Multiple Subscription Issue

**Before:**
```typescript
// Both hooks subscribing to same table with same channel names
useDashboardRealtime() // contacts_*_userId
useContactsRealtime()  // contacts_*_userId (CONFLICT!)
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Unique channel suffixes prevent conflicts
useDashboardRealtime() // contacts_*_userId_dashboard
useContactsRealtime()  // contacts_*_userId_contacts_crud
```

### ‚úÖ 2. Stabilized Callback Functions

**Before:**
```typescript
useRealtimeSubscription('contacts', '*', (payload) => {
  // Inline function recreated on every render
}, [callback]) // ‚ùå Causes re-subscriptions
```

**After:**
```typescript
const stableCallback = useCallback((payload) => {
  // Stable callback reference
}, [])

useRealtimeSubscription('contacts', '*', stableCallback, {
  channelSuffix: 'dashboard'
})
```

### ‚úÖ 3. Enhanced Channel Management

**Added:**
- Global channel tracking to prevent duplicates
- Automatic cleanup of existing channels before creating new ones
- Better error handling and logging
- Force cleanup utility for debugging

### ‚úÖ 4. Improved Connection Monitoring

**Added:**
- Real WebSocket connection status monitoring
- Debug panel showing active channels
- Environment variable validation
- Connection retry logic

## Deployment-Specific Fixes

### For Netlify Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # In Netlify dashboard, add these environment variables:
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   ```

2. **Build Settings**
   ```toml
   # In netlify.toml
   [build]
     command = "npm run build"
     publish = ".next"
   
   [[plugins]]
     package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
   
   [build.environment]
     NEXT_RUNTIME = "nodejs18.x"
   ```

3. **WebSocket Support**
   - Ensure your Netlify plan supports WebSocket connections
   - Check if your domain/subdomain has any WebSocket restrictions

### For Supabase Configuration

1. **Realtime Settings**
   ```sql
   -- Ensure tables are added to realtime publication
   ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE public.contacts;
   ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE public.member_activities;
   ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE public.sent_emails;
   ```

2. **Row Level Security**
   ```sql
   -- Ensure RLS policies allow SELECT access for realtime
   -- Example for contacts table:
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view own contacts" ON public.contacts
     FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = member_id);
   ```

3. **Database URL Format**
   ```
   # Ensure your Supabase URL is correct format:
   https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   
   # NOT:
   https://your-project-id.supabase.co/rest/v1/
   ```

## Testing & Verification

### 1. Use the Debug Panel

The application now includes a debug panel (purple lightning bolt in bottom-right):

- **Connection Status**: Shows realtime connection state
- **Active Channels**: Lists all currently subscribed channels
- **Environment Check**: Validates Supabase configuration
- **Test Actions**: Triggers realtime events for testing

### 2. Browser Console Monitoring

Look for these logs:
```javascript
// Good signs:
‚úÖ Subscribed to contacts_*_userId_dashboard
üîó Realtime connection status: CONNECTED

// Warning signs:
‚ùå Failed to subscribe to contacts_*_userId
üîÑ Cleaning up existing channel: contacts_*_userId
‚ö†Ô∏è Many active channels detected
```

### 3. Network Tab Inspection

1. Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
2. Filter by "WS" (WebSocket)
3. Look for successful WebSocket connection to Supabase
4. Connection should show "101 Switching Protocols" status

## Manual Fixes You Can Apply

### 1. Force Clear All Subscriptions

If you're still seeing multiple subscription errors:

```javascript
// In browser console:
import { cleanupAllChannels } from '@/lib/realtime'
cleanupAllChannels()
```

### 2. Check Environment Variables

```javascript
// In browser console:
console.log({
  url: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL,
  hasKey: !!process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
})
```

### 3. Restart Application

Sometimes a fresh start helps:
```bash
# Kill all Node processes
killall node

# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# Start fresh
npm run dev
```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### ‚úÖ No More Multiple Subscription Errors
- Each subscription uses unique channel names
- No conflicts between dashboard and contact subscriptions

### ‚úÖ Stable WebSocket Connection
- Connection establishes successfully
- Stays connected during normal usage
- Automatically reconnects on network issues

### ‚úÖ Efficient Channel Management
- Only necessary channels are active
- Old channels are properly cleaned up
- Debug panel shows manageable number of channels (< 5)

### ‚úÖ Real-time Updates Work
- Dashboard counters update when data changes
- Contact list updates immediately on add/edit/delete
- Activity feed shows new activities instantly

## Still Having Issues?

### 1. Check Supabase Dashboard
- Go to your Supabase project dashboard
- Navigate to Settings ‚Üí API
- Verify URL and anon key are correct
- Check if realtime is enabled for your project

### 2. Verify Network
- Try from different network (mobile hotspot)
- Check if corporate firewall blocks WebSockets
- Test with VPN if necessary

### 3. Browser-Specific Issues
- Try different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Disable browser extensions temporarily
- Clear browser cache and cookies

### 4. Contact Support
If issues persist, provide:
- Browser console logs
- Network tab WebSocket errors
- Debug panel information
- Supabase project ID (without sensitive keys)

## Summary of Changes Made

1. **Fixed subscription conflicts** with unique channel suffixes
2. **Stabilized callback functions** to prevent re-subscriptions  
3. **Enhanced channel cleanup** and tracking
4. **Improved error handling** and logging
5. **Added comprehensive debugging tools**
6. **Better connection monitoring**

These changes should resolve the "tried to subscribe multiple times" error and WebSocket connection issues you were experiencing.
